# Calculating ROI

In a contest, you effectively make money three ways if you vote on a winning entry:

1. From the contest creator seeding the rewards pool with money you can earn

2. From voters voting on other entries that help fund the rewards pool. Their loss = your gain.

3. From voters voting on your entry after you and paying a higher price/vote. You might have the same number of votes, but they paid more, meaning you’ll split your shares evenly. So you can make money off of their votes as well.

The ROI of each of these three ways can be quite different, so your end ROI may be the average between them.

**But most importantly, while both early and late voters can earn, early voters will always earn the most.**

In an effective contest, early voters provide liquidity into the rewards pool that draws more voters, which provides more liquidity, and so on. If you’re an early voter, you take on higher risk with higher return by voting with conviction. If you’re a late voter, you have lower risk and lower return—and can make money, even while subsidizing early voters.

This also means that whales can earn while subsidizing early conviction voters, rather than just extracting from them.

Ultimately, you never know how much you’re going to earn until the contest ends. Nevertheless, you might still want to perform some calculations to see what’s possible—and to gauge the moment where continuing to vote, even on a winning entry, could end up losing you money.

## Here’s the quick guide for how to math

### Your ultimate payout is a simple formula

(My share of votes on entry) * (Total rewards pool) * (Percent of rewards to entry)

Let’s say you have 10% of the votes on 1st place, and 1st place gets 80% of the rewards. If there are $10,000 in the rewards pool, then you get:

(0.1) * ($10,000) * (.8) = $800


### The Most you could earn

(Percent of rewards to entry) * 0.9 * (final price per vote) * (total number of entries in contest) * (Number of votes I’m buying)

Let’s say 1st place gets 80% of rewards, the final price per vote is $1/vote, there’s 10 entries, and I’m buying 100 votes at $0.10/vote.

.8 * 0.9 * 1 * 10 * 100 = $720

Now to calculate my max ROI, I divide that by the amount I’m spending. I’m spending $10 (0.1*100), so my max ROI is $720/$10 or 72x!

We’ll spare you the math for how we arrived at this formula, but the basic idea is this: for you to make *the most* money, then you want everyone voting in the final minute (when they pay the most for the last amount of votes) as much as possible on every single entry, with yours winning. Once you take the limit of this function as the votes approach infinity and cancel out some variables, you get the formula above.

The end number is not intended as a realistic indicator of how much you’ll actually earn, but an upper limit that your earnings will converge to as more and more people play.

### How much you’d earn if the contest ended right now

(My percent of votes on entry)*(percent of rewards to entry)*(current rewards+(0.9)*(my funds))

Let’s say there’s 900 votes on 1st place, you’re going to buy 100 more at $1/vote. Let’s also say that 1st place gets 80% of the rewards, and there’s $1000 in the rewards pool. 

In other words, you’re buying $100 of votes (100*1), and you’ll have 10% of the votes on the entry (100/1000). So if the contest ended now, you’d earn:

(0.1)*(0.8)($1000+(0.9)*100)) = (0.08)($1090) = $87.2. 

So even though this is the winning entry, you’d actually lose money if the contest ended right now! Of course, if more people keep voting, then you could easily earn much more.

But this is why this formula is useful. It’s particularly helpful for two cases:

1. There’s a clear winner… but is it worth it to vote on it at this point in the game?
2. There’s a clear loser… but if you bought enough votes to help it win, could you still make money?

This is important. It’s easy to think that voting on the clear winners is the way to earn, but this isn’t always true. Sometimes following the crowd means you lose money, while opposing it means you can gain quite a bit. 

Finally, keep in mind this formula only works if you’re voting for an entry that ends up winning, or an entry that will win once you give it enough votes.
