# Frequently Asked Questions

## JokeRace Basics

### What is a contest?

A contest is just a way for people to vote on their favorite entries. During the voting period, anyone can buy up votes on a price curve, with 90% of their funds going into a rewards pool; if they vote on the winners, they can claim their share of the rewards.

Before the voting period opens, contestants can submit their entries—or the contest creator may only allowlist themselves to submit these entries. a rewards pool; if they vote on the winners, they can claim their share of the rewards.
Popular contest use cases include demo days, integration decisions, Product-Hunt style leaderboards, community awards,  best meme/tweet/essay competitions, feature requests, polls, and even reality TV show-style votes.etc. Any kind of community decision is, effectively, a contest.

### Do I need a crypto experience to play in a contest on JokeRace?
No, Para allows anyone to join JokeRace contests without needing crypto. When you choose the “login with Para” option to sign up, a wallet is created for you automatically. From there you can add funds using Apple Pay, a debit card, or your Coinbase account.

How do I send funds?
1. tap user profile (upper right)
2. tap “send funds”
3. send funds from your wallet wherever you like

There’s no need to rely on external apps to manage your funds. There’s no need to be dependent on embedded ones to custody them. Your funds are yours.

### Which chains can I add cash to?
See the full list of supported chains [here](https://help.coinbase.com/en/wallet/getting-started/what-types-of-crypto-does-wallet-support)

### How do I claim my funds when I vote on winning entries?
Just go to "my rewards" tab and you'll see a button to claim rewards for each entry that won. Note that in the case of a tie, these go to the contest creator to distribute, and you should reach out to them.

### Why is JokeRace onchain?

Onchain contests give you five benefits you couldn’t get offchain.

1. Monetization. Voters can earn by voting on winners, creating fun stakes, disincentivizing botting, and, well, enabling them to make real money. In a traditional auction process, for example, the winning bidder would lose money; in a contest, they gain money, incentivizing them to participate.

2. Attention. The financial incentives drive attention: for example, voters will want to learn about competing projects and teams in order to determine which they want to win, and they’ll be incentivized to get others to vote for these entries as well. Likewise, they will give their attention to the community throwing the contest.

3. Reputation. Every vote in an onchain contest is an attestation that an entry was valuable. By participating in your contest, players earn powerful onchain reputation they can leverage for years to come. But reputation is also important for you as a contest creator: now you can easily track your most valuable users in case you ever want to offer them airdrops, access, or power within citizens councils in your own community.

4. Insight. Onchain data gives you powerful insight into your community. At a high level, you can leverage onchain data to see which members are most active, which entrants and voters are most valuable, which ideas command the most passion, and which commonalities exist between players: you could even build a whole social graph of shared user tastes. But at a deeper level, you can also get full insights from customer segmentation about power users’ onchain activity across other protocols and projects.

5. Executability. Anyone can build modules on top of JokeRace so that the result of a vote triggers an action on their service. Hats has already built a module to give winners role-based NFTs, but other modules could include minting winning entries or executing a winning piece of code. By building onchain, we can be the decision layer of the internet.

6. Gamification. Give credentials that let winners move up the ranks of future contests. Incentivize your community to complete onchain actions on your service to get more voting power. Livestream a contest with limited contestants and let thousands of voters vote from home.

### Can you delete entries?

Contest creators can delete or batch delete entries during the entry and voting periods. Nobody can delete entries after the first vote is cast. To preserve trust, we highly recommend only removing entries that clearly violate your contest instructions.

### I created a contest and want to edit it. Can I update any part of it?

You can edit the header image, title and description of your contest. If you need to update anything else you can cancel the contest then redeploy a new one.

### How do I find the contract address for a contest?

Copy the url of the contest. The last string of letters and numbers is the contract address. Every url is formatted as follows: www.jokerace.io/contest/[chain]/[contract-address]

### Can I verify this contract?

Yes! See [Verifying Contracts](/technical-how-tos/verifying-contracts).

### Can voters vote once or multiple times?

Voters can buy as many votes as they can afford, and they can vote as many times as they like on as many entries as they like. Decimal voting is not allowed.

### Which chains is JokeRace live on?

You can see the comprehensive list of chains we're live on [here](https://github.com/jk-labs-inc/jokerace/tree/staging/packages/react-app-revamp/config/wagmi/custom-chains).

### What are fields?

Fields are exactly what they sound like: fields that contests creators can require players to fill out when entering their contest. But because these fields are all metadata—meaning they can be read permissionlessly by any smart contract onchain—anyone can parse and query the responses in the fields in order to use them as variables to execute their own smart contract logic.

To put that simply, fields enable new ways to handle funding, rewards, and attestations.

When a contest creator adds fields to entries, they effectively require that entrants fill out these fields in the correct format. (The main field in an entry, however, is optional.) Currently there are three formats for additional fields:

1. a string (any combo of letters and numbers)
2. a number (integer)
3. a contract or token address

Basically, you can build smart contracts on top of contests to execute *any* kind of logic involving strings, numbers, and addresses, in order to determine allocations, funding, reputation, etc.

All of this can be done programmatically on [top of our contest smart contracts](https://docs.jokerace.io/technical-how-tos/jokerace-onchain-data).

### What file types can I upload as part of a contest entry?

You can currently upload links, text and images to any type of contest. 

Please note that for title format contests only the title will be displayed on the contest page and users will need to click the entry itself to view any attached images.

If you’re hoping to run a multimedia contest with video or audio we suggest selecting the “tweet” format for your contest–users can upload the media to their tweet and enter the tweet to the contest.

### What does it mean if a tweet entry isn’t visible?

It means that twitter (x.com) itself is blocking the post from being seen publicly. The post may have been deleted, may be from a private or deactivated account, or may be marked as sensitive content on Twitter’s end.

## Extensions

### What are extensions?

Extensions are 3rd party integrations built on top of JokeRace’s protocol that extend the features and functionality of contests.
Anyone can build an extension permissionlessly, and we’ll feature select ones on our site that link to the 3rd party’s integration. We want users to discover the services of anyone who has built on top of us.

### What should I do if I want to build an extension?

First of all, dm us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/jokerace_io)! We’d love to hear what you’re up to and see if we can support.

JokeRace is fully onchain, so we have no API: the blockchain itself is effectively our API. You can query and parse and listen to any data you need directly from the chain, as each contest is its own smart contract.

Generally the strongest extensions will include:

1. A standalone page for a given contest—or for users to input the url to a contest. This lets us link directly to a page that’s specifically relevant to JokeRace.
2. Ample context on the page about how the extension works and what each field means (or, alternately, a link to docs explaining these).
3. Support for as many EVM chains as possible.

Not all extensions should look the same, however. We want JokeRace to be able to feed data and metadata into everything from analytics and points platforms to onchain execution services, so our top goal is expanding use cases for partners.

### What are examples of extensions?

Current extensions include:

- Viewing contest analytics on Dune
- Assigning roles and powers to winners of contests with Hats Protocol
- Rewarding winners NFTs with Coinvise

Potential future extensions could include:

- Minting winning entries as NFTs
- Deploying capital with parameters set by the winning entry
- Buying back tokens with the fees accrued by the contest
- Reenterting fees from contest into rewards
- Slashing node operators based on the vote of a contest
- Adding winners to a multisig
- Revoking membership in a community
- Curating data sets to train an AI agent
- Approving an AI agent to take actions onchain

## Troubleshooting

### I can’t enter the contest — what’s happening?

It is likely that the contest creator only allowlisted themselves to submit entries for this contest; it is also possible that voting has opened or the contest has closed, so it’s no longer possible to submit entries. Entries must be submitted before voting starts. If not, please [file a bug report](https://github.com/jk-labs-inc/jokerace/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=bug%3A+).

## Vote-And-Earn

### Can I withdraw funds from a rewards pool I created?

The contest creator can withdraw rewards from the rewards pool at any time until the first vote is cast. Once the first vote is cast, it is no longer possible to withdraw funds.

### Can I withdraw funds from a rewards pool I funded?

Only contest creators can withdraw funds of the associated rewards pool. If you are not the contest creator, we highly recommend that you do not fund a rewards pool, as there is no way for you to withdraw funds.

### What is vote-and-earn?

Vote-and-earn means that voters can earn from voting on winning entries. With price curves, the price per vote rises steadily every minute, incentivizing early voters to vote with conviction in order to claim a greater share of the rewards and earn much more.

### What are Price curves?

Price curves increase the price per vote at every minute throughout the contest, incentivizing early, high-conviction votes. Early voters can claim a greater share of the votes for much cheaper, enabling them to benefit from significantly lower prices, higher potential returns, and rewards from all subsequent voters who help subsidize their earnings. This approach aligns incentives, maximizes potential returns, and enhances contest engagement.

### Who pays for the rewards?

90% of all voting fees go into the rewards pool, creating a liquidity flywheel: as voters vote, rewards go up, incentivizing more voters to vote in turn. In addition, you can seed the rewards pool to help kickstart the contest (we generally recommend seeding with $100-200 that helps incentivize initial voters to play).

### How do voter rewards work?
- Voters buy as many votes as they like on an entry or entries 90% of their funds go  into the rewards pool
- Voters on winning entries can claim their share of the rewards at the end of the contest on the “My Rewards” tab.

Additional considerations:
- The rewards pool is split by placement (e.g. 80% to 1st place voters, 20% to 2nd voters)
- With price curves, costs per vote increase continuously (e.g., 7.5% per minute), incentivizing early votes at lower prices. Early voters thus stand to earn more as subsequent voters contribute increasingly larger amounts into the pool.
- Each voter on those winning entries earns a share **proportional to the number of votes they cast**.

- For example:
  - Let’s assume there’s a contest where the creator sets 80% of the rewards pool to go to 1st place voters and 20% to 2nd place voters. The creator **does not** fund this pool independently but lets it self-fund. $1000 is spent on votes across the entire contest.
  - 90% ($900) goes to the rewards pool
  - 80% of the pool goes to the 1st place entry = $720
  - 20% goes to the 2nd place entry = $180
  - If you cast 5 of 50 votes on the 1st place entry (10%), you earn $72

### Do all voters get rewarded?
No. Only voters on the **winning entry (or entries**, if the contest rewards multiple placements) receive a portion of the rewards pool. The more you contribute to that entry’s total votes, the more you’ll earn. And with price curves, earlier votes may yield dramatically higher returns.

### Why do you recommend a two-hour voting period?

First, two hour contests play out like a traditional sports game, creating a much more fun experience where people can play along throughout the contest. Past two or three hours, it's hard for people to play in the contest live, defend their vote, and have fun strategizing about how to win.

Second, price curves usually make it prohibitive to enter a contest after the first half or so, which is the point: people should buy votes early with conviction, not just wait to buy votes on the clear winner. So extending contests doesn’t actually give more opportunities to players, since players will generally want to play from the start and continue playing throughout.

If you’re concerned that two hours isn’t enough time for people to discover the contest, we *highly* encourage creating the contest a week in advance and dropping the link so that people can plan to play in it—as in a sports game. Likewise, you can run bracket tournaments with a series of one-on-one contests every day that help build momentum and give more opportunities for players to participate.

With that said, you can set the voting period to last up to 24 hours.

### Why does jk labs take a 10% cut of charges?

A 10% cut is what funds the protocol and helps ensure contests are more fair and engaging. Here’s why:

- Prevents whales from farming rewards: The 10% cut disincentivizes whales from swooping in with a large pot of money to claim 1st place and earn from everyone else’s vote, since they effectively need to pay a 10% charge on their own votes. For example, it is extremely risky for a whale to drop $1,000,000 on an entry at the start: either they discourage other voters from participating, thus incurring a $100,000 fee, or they create a honey pot for other voters to band together and try to claim the $1,000,000 in the rewards pool.

### How does this change voter strategy?

Voter rewards introduce real decision-making into contests. For example:
- You want to vote on entries that can win—since only winning voters earn
- Voters should always question whether it’s actually worth it to vote for a consensus option that’s likely to win: even if they vote for a winner, they could still lose money if they vote late in the game when the price curve has driven up the cost per vote… meaning that they’ve had to pay much more than earlier voters for a smaller share of the rewards. Voters can always check the [calculations for ROI](https://docs.jokerace.io/calculating-roi) and can always earn the most by voting with conviction early.
- With that said, there may still be reasons to vote later. Voters might still be able to make money up to a certain point on entries. Voters might want to defend an entry they voted for earlier. Or voters could still make money if other voters vote after them, helping subsidize their win.
- The more entries in a contest, the greater the risk and reward for players. For example, if there are two entries, then one needs 51% to win. if there are 10, then one might only need 11%. This means that the risk and reward are both much greater since you can win 90% of rewards for 11% of the vote, but of course it's less likely you will.

Price Curves create significantly deeper strategy:
- **Reward Conviction**: Early votes are cheaper, offering much higher risk and return, with greater rewards for voting with conviction.
- **Liquidity Flywheel**: Because voters earn more from voting early, they can provide liquidity into the rewards pool that then draws more people to play, setting off a liquidity flywheel that brings in more and more players as the contest continues.
- **Virality Incentives**: Earnings come from everyone voting after you, encouraging voters to persuade others to follow their choices.
- **Drama**: By creating FOMO and escalating rewards, contests become much more fun as the stakes rise continuously.

### Who is responsible for KYC verification in contests?

Contest creators are fully responsible for the deployment and ownership of smart contracts that handle contest rewards. This means that any KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements are up to the contest creator’s discretion and are not managed by us. It’s important that contest creators conduct their own due diligence and ensure that their KYC process aligns with any applicable regulations.

### How high do rewards do need to be for me to KYC?

Generally, KYC requirements vary by jurisdiction. Because they’re not universal, we recommend that contest creators do your own diligence to confirm compliance with local regulations.

### If a contestant’s entry is deleted, can they re-enter the contest?

Yes: by default, contestants can enter up to 1000 times, so even if they delete a number of entries, they should still have plenty of slots to reenter.

### What happens if I delete entries? 

If you delete entries from your contest, it opens up additional slots for new entries. For example, if your contest allows 1,000 entries and is completely full, you can still delete 100, and 100 additional entries can be entered.

### Do rewards in the rewards pool need to be ERC20s on the same chain as the contest?

Yes. If you want to reward ERC-20s from another chain, please bridge them over to the same chain as the contest first, and then use them to fund the pool. If you want to reward NFTs, you can do so manually by sending them directly to the winners.

### What happens in the case of a tie?

Ties are complicated!

That's why in the case of ties, the funds for the potential winners get disbursed back to the creator to make a call and handle manually.

**How and when rewards return to contest creator:**
All affected ranks will have their rewards returned to the contest creator. That includes any ranks that incurred a tie, as well as any ranks below. For example, if the contest has rewards set for 1st, 2nd and 3rd place, but multiple contestants tied for 2nd, then only the reward funds that were on hold for 2nd and 3rd will be returned to the contest creator.

We recommend including your own policy for ties in your contest description to share with players.

**What happens if I need to distribute rewards to multiple people?**
If you need to distribute rewards to multiple people, go to the extensions tab of your contest and tap the “see analytics” button to access a dashboard of everyone who entered or voted. (Please note dashboards are only supported on major chains, so if you don’t see the link, you’ll need to pull these addresses manually.) You can then use a tool like disperse.app to distribute the rewards to multiple addresses. We do not own and are not liable for any dispersal apps.

## Circuits
Circuits are a mechanism for contest creators to direct earnings to independent smart contracts that perform onchain transactions. That means that whenever a player in a contest enters, votes, or performs any kind of action generating earnings, they can simultaneously perform any onchain action, such as buying tokens, minting collectibles, providing liquidity, or earning credentials—all as part of playing in a contest.

Check out the [technical documentation page](/technical-how-tos/circuits) for more in-depth information.

## Reputation 

### How can I use JokeRace for points and reputation?

One easy way to imagine JokeRace is as a ledger of user preferences and attestations. Whenever one person votes for an entry, they’re expressing a preference for it—and attesting to its value. Likewise whenever a person who has entered an entry earns a vote, they’re earning an attestation that their entry was valuable to the community that voted.

What this means is that even if you lose a contest, you still win—because you’re earning reputation. For example, if a community designed a simple point system that offered one “point” for every vote a person received, they would be able to gauge the value that this person had contributed to the community—by merely adding up the onchain votes over time. With a legitimate voterpool, this system couldn’t be botted or overrun by airdrop farmers. Submitters would actually have to create value for the community to earn value in return.

But this is just one example. In fact, because JokeRace is fully onchain, you can use any data point from contests to determine your own system of rewarding reputation.

To get analytics on your contest, tap the “extensions” tab and “see analytics” button. your contest dashboard shows you everyone who entered and voted. just pull their addresses and you can give them
- airdrops
- community access
- credentials
- reimbursements

## AI Agents

### Is there a way to get AI agents to play in contests?

[James Young](https://x.com/jamesyoung) has devised a framework to create AI agents that can interact on JokeRace. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/collabland/AI-Agent-Starter-Kit/blob/b235d05ee05e4386ed433dae2e1bec85156507cc/.env.example#L12).

## Dashboards

### How do I access my contest dashboard?

1. Navigate to your contest page
2. Click the "Extensions" tab
3. Select "See Analytics"
4. Click "Run" to load the latest data

Notes:
- Be patient - initial data loading can take several minutes
- Click "Run" anytime you want to refresh the data
- Not all contests have dashboards available - if the chain that a contest is on is not supported by [Dune](https://dune.com/) then it will not have a dashboard

### What data can I see?

The dashboard shows:
- Total revenue
- Number of entries and entrants
- Number of votes and unique voters
- Entry IDs and voter addresses
- Proposer addresses
- Detailed voting patterns
