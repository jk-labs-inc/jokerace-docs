# Frequently Asked Questions

## JokeRace Basics

### What is a contest?

A contest is just a way for people to submit entries and people to vote on their favorites. Every contest includes two periods: an entry period and a voting period. The participants in each might be totally different, exactly the same, or subsets of each other—you have complete control to decide who can enter and who can vote. You can define the addresses that can enter or vote—or let anyone enter or vote (in the latter case, they'll just need to pay per vote to avoid botting).

After you create a contest, you can add and fund an optional rewards pool too. The rewards pool is set up proportionately—for example, you might offer 60% of rewards to voters on 1st place, 30% to voters on 2nd, 10% to voters on 3rd—and anyone can execute the transaction to send any rewards in the pool to the rewarded voters after the contest is over.

Popular contest use cases include grants, hackathons, governance, bounties, ideathons, giveaways, awards ceremonies, best meme/tweet/essay competitions, feature requests, polls, game shows, etc. etc. Any kind of community decision is, effectively, a contest.

### Do I need a crypto experience to play in a contest on JokeRace?
No, Para allows anyone to join JokeRace contests without needing crypto. When you choose the “login with Para” option to sign up, a wallet is created for you automatically. From there you can add funds using Apple Pay, a debit card, or your Coinbase account.

How do I send funds?
1. tap user profile (upper right)
2. tap “send funds”
3. send funds from your wallet wherever you like

There’s no need to rely on external apps to manage your funds. There’s no need to be dependent on embedded ones to custody them. Your funds are yours.

### Which chains can I add cash to?
See the full list of supported chains [here](https://help.coinbase.com/en/wallet/getting-started/what-types-of-crypto-does-wallet-support)

### How do I claim my funds when I win?
Just go to "my rewards" tab and you'll see a button to claim rewards for each entry you voted on that won. Unless there's a tie, in which case these go to the contest creator to distribute, and you should reach out to them.

### Why is JokeRace onchain?

Onchain contests give you five benefits you couldn’t get offchain.

1. Monetization. Monetizable contests are only possible by building onchain. There is no way to programatically offer rewards to voters offchain. And just as importantly, there is no way to monetize contests directly offchain either—whereas onchain, we can split all commissions with you 90/10 so that everyone can earn. And that’s with 0 credit card or appstore fees that you’d incur offchain. All of this means we are the only way for projects to build a viable business through contests.

2. Reputation. Every vote in an onchain contest is an attestation that an entry was valuable. If Vitalik votes for you in an onchain hackathon, you have a permanent portable attestation that can get you access to communities, airdrops, and job opportunities... even if you lose the hackathon. This is why reputation is crucial as a user incentive: by participating in your contest, players earn powerful onchain reputation they can leverage for years to come. But reputation is also important for you as a contest creator: now you can easily track your most valuable users in case you ever want to offer them airdrops, access, or power within citizens councils in your own community.

3. Insight. Onchain data gives you powerful insight into your community. At a high level, you can leverage onchain data to see which members are most active, which entrants and voters are most valuable, which ideas command the most passion, and which commonalities exist between players: you could even build a whole social graph of shared user tastes. But at a deeper level, you can also get full insights from customer segmentation about power users’ onchain activity across other protocols and projects.

4. Executability. Anyone can build modules on top of JokeRace so that the result of a vote triggers an action on their service. Hats has already built a module to give winners role-based NFTs, but other modules could include minting winning entries or executing a winning piece of code. By building onchain, we can be the decision layer of the internet.

5. Gamification. Give credentials that let winners move up the ranks of future contests. Incentivize your community to complete onchain actions on your service to get more voting power. Livestream a contest with limited contestants and let thousands of voters vote from home. Or maybe most significantly, let entrants know they can (and often do) create their own incentives for voters by leveraging onchain data.

### Can you delete entries?

Contest creators can delete or batch delete entries during the entry and voting periods. Nobody can delete entries after the contest closes (after the voting period). To preserve trust, we highly recommend only removing entries that clearly violate your contest instructions.

### I created a contest and want to edit it. Can I update any part of it?

You can edit the header image, title and description of your contest. If you need to update anything else you can cancel the contest then redeploy a new one.

### How do I find the contract address for a contest?

Copy the url of the contest. The last string of letters and numbers is the contract address. Every url is formatted as follows: www.jokerace.io/contest/[chain]/[contract-address]

### Can I verify this contract?

Yes! See [Verifying Contracts](/technical-how-tos/verifying-contracts).

### If I delete an entry, how does that affect who can enter?

If you delete an entry, it will open up one more slot for total entries. So let’s say your contest accepts 100 entries, and all 100 have been entered. If you delete 1, there will now be room for one more entry (assuming the entry period is still open).

However, the person whose entry you deleted does not get a bonus entry as a result. So if you only let each wallet enter one entry, the player whose entry was deleted cannot enter another entry from that wallet.

### I want to input the entries myself for everyone to vote on—what’s the best way to do this?

First, when you create the contest, just allowlist yourself to enter. You can do this by selecting “manual entry” for the entry allowlist, and just copy-pasting your address in the top row.

Second, when you’re creating the contest, just make sure that entrants (ie you) can enter enough entries. On the “customizations” page, tap the “max” button under “how many entries can each player enter?” This will let you enter as many entries as you like.

### Can voters vote once or multiple times?

Voters can vote as many times as they like—as long as they have enough votes. Decimal voting is not allowed, so a voter with 1 vote could only vote once. A voter with 100 votes, however, could deploy all 100 votes to one entry, or 50 to one entry and 50 to another, or spread 100 votes across 100 entries. They can always return to give more votes to entries as well.

### Which chains is JokeRace live on?

You can see the comprehensive list of chains we're live on [here](https://github.com/jk-labs-inc/jokerace/tree/staging/packages/react-app-revamp/config/wagmi/custom-chains).

### How can I tell which contests are legitimate?

We feature top legitimate ones on our front page. But if you’re concerned, you can check any user’s profile to see the previous contests they deployed to see the traction they’ve gotten and onchain rewards they offered (and by extension, whether they were legitimate). Projects themselves will typically feature links to contests as well, so you can verify here too.

If for any reason you are concerned about the legitimacy of a contest, please feel free to reach out, and remember that the risk you face is simply in lost fees for enterting or voting in the contest. For that reason, however, we encourage you *never* to send funds to a rewards pool that isn’t your own.

### What are fields?

Fields are exactly what they sound like: fields that contests creators can require players to fill out when entering their contest. But because these fields are all metadata—meaning they can be read permissionlessly by any smart contract onchain—anyone can parse and query the responses in the fields in order to use them as variables to execute their own smart contract logic.

To put that simply, fields enable new ways to handle funding, rewards, and attestations.

When a contest creator adds fields to entries, they effectively require that entrants fill out these fields in the correct format. (The main field in an entry, however, is optional.) Currently there are three formats for additional fields:

1. a string (any combo of letters and numbers)
2. a number (integer)
3. a contract or token address

Here’s a few examples of how you could build new use cases on top of fields:

- **Nominating someone to win a prize**: You could hold a contest for anyone to nominate a winner who would earn a prize. Just add a field for players to give the nominee's address, and then easily send rewards to the nominee directly, rather than to the entrant who nominated them.


- **Raising funds for a cause**: Let's say you want to raise funds for a nonprofit—but have no money. You could throw a contest for people to nominate a nonprofit by giving its address. And you could then collect entry and voting fees from the contest itself and send these to the winner. The contest itself would fund the donation.


- **Making money from publicly-chosen awards**: Now let's say you want to make money while letting the public pick who earns an award, gets to speak at a conference, gets to appear on your podcast, etc. You can let anyone nominate a speaker, and add a field to collect their address. You could then keep the funds from the contest but give credentials to all the nominated winners.


- **Managing a treasury**: Contest entrants could describe their proposed treasury management system and enter a field with an associated contract address. The contract for the winner could be executed, fully onchain.

Basically, you can build smart contracts on top of contests to execute *any* kind of logic involving strings, numbers, and addresses, in order to determine allocations, funding, reputation, etc.

All of this can be done programmatically on [top of our contest smart contracts](https://docs.jokerace.io/technical-how-tos/jokerace-onchain-data).

## Monetization

### How can I monetize from creating contests?

On the final page of creating a contest, you can set monetization options to charge players for enterting and voting. JokeRace splits these fees with you 90/10, and you can set these as high as you like. (Please note this is only available on major chains and includes a minimum price to set). At the lowest end, a charge helps maintain high-quality entries and deters bots; it’s comparable to standard fees in many grant processes or festivals. At the higher end, you can charge users higher amounts if the incentives are great enough (see below).

So for example, let’s say you want to create a game show that runs each week. You might start by having relatively low entry fees with low rewards. The next week, you might take your earnings from entries and put them into a slightly higher rewards pool—justifying a slightly higher entry fee. Rinse, repeat, and over time you can raise rates sustainably.

This is only one option for monetizing. Other communities may want to use contests to give utility to their token or to leverage the data from the contests to get sponsors attuned with their users. Still others might want to get sponsors for the rewards and take a cut.

There are endless ways to monetize contests, some natively on JokeRace’s site, and some off-site as well.

## Extensions

### What are extensions?

Extensions are 3rd party integrations built on top of JokeRace’s protocol that extend the features and functionality of contests.
Anyone can build an extension permissionlessly, and we’ll feature select ones on our site that link to the 3rd party’s integration. We want users to discover the services of anyone who has built on top of us.

### What should I do if I want to build an extension?

First of all, dm us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/jokerace_io)! We’d love to hear what you’re up to and see if we can support.

JokeRace is fully onchain, so we have no API: the blockchain itself is effectively our API. You can query and parse and listen to any data you need directly from the chain, as each contest is its own smart contract.

Generally the strongest extensions will include:

1. A standalone page for a given contest—or for users to input the url to a contest. This lets us link directly to a page that’s specifically relevant to JokeRace.
2. Ample context on the page about how the extension works and what each field means (or, alternately, a link to docs explaining these).
3. Support for as many EVM chains as possible.

Not all extensions should look the same, however. We want JokeRace to be able to feed data and metadata into everything from analytics and points platforms to onchain execution services, so our top goal is expanding use cases for partners.

### What are examples of extensions?

Current extensions include:

- Viewing contest analytics on Dune
- Assigning roles and powers to winners of contests with Hats Protocol
- Rewarding winners NFTs with Coinvise

Potential future extensions could include:

- Minting winning entries as NFTs
- Deploying capital with parameters set by the winning entry
- Buying back tokens with the fees accrued by the contest
- Reenterting fees from contest into rewards
- Slashing node operators based on the vote of a contest
- Adding winners to a multisig
- Revoking membership in a community
- Curating data sets to train an AI agent
- Approving an AI agent to take actions onchain

## Troubleshooting

### I can’t enter or vote—what’s happening?

Please [file a bug report](https://github.com/jk-labs-inc/jokerace/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=bug%3A+).

## Rewards

### How does funding the rewards pool work?

You can fund the rewards pool on the “rewards” page or sending ERC20s directly to the contract address on the rewards page.

### Can I withdraw funds from a rewards pool I created?

The contest creator can withdraw rewards from the rewards pool until the first vote is cast on the underlying contest, after that point the creator cannot withdraw. You will also have to cancel the rewards pool before you can withdraw from it.

### Can I withdraw funds from a rewards pool I funded?

Only contest creators can withdraw funds of the associated rewards pool. If you are not the contest creator, we highly recommend that you do not fund a rewards pool, as there is no way for you to withdraw funds.

### What is vote-and-earn?
Vote-and-earn means that voters can earn from voting on winning entries when you add a rewards pool for voters to a contest (contest creators can find this on the “my rewards” tab of the contest). And with price curves, voting costs rise steadily, rewarding early voters who can earn significantly higher returns as later voters drive up the pool.

### What are Price curves?
Price curves steadily increase vote prices throughout the contest, incentivizing early, high-conviction votes. Early voters benefit from significantly lower prices, higher potential returns, and rewards from all subsequent voters. This approach aligns incentives, maximizes potential returns, and enhances contest engagement.

### Who pays for the rewards?
Rewards come from the contest’s reward pool. That pool is funded by voting charges and the creator can also add to it directly as well.

### How do voter rewards work?
- Voters pay to cast votes, like usual
- 90% of each voting charge also goes into the rewards pool
- That pool is split by placement (e.g. 80% to 1st place, 20% to 2nd)
- With price curves, costs per vote increase continuously (e.g., 7.5% per minute), incentivizing early votes at lower prices. Early voters thus stand to earn more as subsequent voters contribute increasingly larger amounts into the pool.
- After the contest ends, rewards are distributed to voters on the winning entry. Each voter on those winning entries earns a share **proportional to the number of votes they cast**
- For example:
  - Let’s assume there’s a contest where the creator sets 80% of the rewards pool to go to 1st place voters and 20% to 2nd place voters. The creator **does not** fund this pool independently but lets it self-fund.
  - $1000 is spent on votes across the entire contest
  - 90% ($900) goes to the rewards pool
  - 80% of the pool goes to the 1st place entry = $720
  - 20% goes to the 2nd place entry = $180
  - If you cast 5 of 50 votes on the 1st place entry (10%), you earn $72

### Do all voters get rewarded?
No. Only voters on the **winning entry (or entries)**, if the contest rewards multiple placements) receive a portion of the rewards pool. The more you contribute to that entry’s total votes, the more you’ll earn. And with price curves, earlier votes may yield dramatically higher returns.

### Why does jk labs take a 10% cut of charges?
A 10% cut helps ensure contests  are more fair and engaging. Here’s why:
- Prevents whales from farming rewards: The 10% cut helps ensure  brute-force winning is unprofitable. It disincentivizes whales from swooping in with a large pot of money to claim 1st place and earn from everyone else’s vote, since they effectively need to pay a 10% charge on their own votes. 
- Encourages diverse voting: Once an entry has 90% of votes (assuming only 1st place voters earn), it’s no longer profitable to continue voting on that entry, so contestantsparticipants should consider all viable options to vote on. Likewise, voters can only earn if players vote on *other* entries in order to increase the rewards pool that lets them earn more than the 10% they pay. This helps encourage everyone to help share the contest with the most diverse contestantsparticipants possible in order to maximize their own rewards. 

### How does this change voter strategy?
Voter rewards introduce real decision-making into contests. For example:
- You want to vote on entries that can win—since only winning voters earn
- Once an entry in a fully self-funded contest has a certain percentage of votes [90%*(percent that their rank earns)], then voters can no longer earn from it. For example, let’s say 1st place voters get 100% of the rewards pool, and the rewards pool is funded by 90% of charges. If voters pay for 1000% of votes, and only get 90% of the funds from voting, then they effectively lose. 
- The more entries in a contest, the greater the risk and reward for players. For example, if there are two entries, then one needs 51% to win. if there are 10, then one might only need 11%. This means that the risk and reward are both much greater since you can win 90% of rewards for 11% of the vote, but of course it's less likely you will.

Price Curves create significantly deeper strategy:
- Reward Conviction: Early votes are cheaper, offering much higher risk and return, with greater rewards for voting with conviction.
- Liquidity Flywheel: Because voters earn more from voting early, they can provide liquidity into the rewards pool that then draws more people to play, setting off a liquidity flywheel that brings in more and more players as the contest continues.
- Virality Incentives: Earnings come from everyone voting after you, encouraging voters to persuade others to follow their choices.
- Drama: By creating FOMO and escalating rewards, contests become much more fun as the stakes rise continuously.

### Who is responsible for KYC verification in contests?

Contest creators are fully responsible for the deployment and ownership of smart contracts that handle contest rewards. This means that any KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements are up to the contest creator’s discretion and are not managed by us. It’s important that contest creators conduct their own due diligence and ensure that their KYC process aligns with any applicable regulations.

### How high do rewards do need to be for me to KYC?

Generally, KYC requirements vary by jurisdiction. Because they’re not universal, we recommend that contest creators do your own diligence to confirm compliance with local regulations. JokeRace does not enforce KYC limits directly.

### Can I KYC users within the contest?

If you want to KYC players, we recommend adding a field for contestants to respond to where they can link any KYC verification. 

### If a contestant’s entry is deleted, can they re-enter the contest?

It depends on how many entries a contestant is allowed to enter in a contest. For example, if a contestant is allowed to enter two entries, then they can delete their first and still enter a second. However, if they were only allowed to enter one entry, then they will not be allowed to re-enter after deleting their entry. For this reason, we recommend letting contestants enter twice, just in case they need to delete and re-enter.

### What happens if the total number of entries in my contest changes?

If you delete entries from your contest, it opens up additional slots for new entries. For example, if your contest allows 1,000 entries and is completely full, you can still delete 100, and 100 additional entries can be enterted.

### Do rewards in the rewards pool need to be ERC20s on the same chain as the contest?

Yes. If you want to reward ERC-20s from another chain, please bridge them over to the same chain as the contest first, and then use them to fund the pool. If you want to reward NFTs, you can do so manually by sending them directly to the winners.

### What happens in the case of a tie?

Ties are complicated!

That's why in the case of ties, the funds for the potential winners get disbursed back to the creator to make a call and handle manually.

**How and when rewards return to contest creator:**
All affected ranks will have their rewards returned to the contest creator. that includes any ranks that incurred a tie, as well as any ranks below. For example, if the contest has rewards set for 1st, 2nd and 3rd place, but multiple contestants tied for 2nd, then only the reward funds that were on hold for 2nd and 3rd will be returned to the contest creator.

We recommend including your own policy for ties in your contest description to share with players. If you're looking for a specific policy, you’re welcome to copy-paste our own policy we use when we run contests.

“In the case that x players are tied for a given rank, they will get an equal share of the sum of rewards for that rank and the (x-1) ranks that follow it distributed among them. for example, if 3 players tie for 2nd place, they will get the shares of 2nd-4th place distributed among all three equally, and the 3rd place winner would now get 5th place.

In the case where there are more tied players than remaining ranks, they will get the remainder of rewards distributed to them. for example, if 3 players tie for 2nd place, but only the top 3 ranks get rewards, then these 3 players will split the sum of rewards from 2nd and 3rd place equally.”

You're welcome to follow any policy you like, but we use this one because it sticks as closely as possible to the original intention of rewards, in which the ranks should correspond to the total number of players (or be shared evenly at the bottom).

In other words, if we accounted for 5 winners with 5 ranks, then our goal is to try to have those rewards go to the top 5 winners… or to split them if there's a tie at the bottom.

You can see what that looks like in a case where two players tie for 3rd, and two tie for 4th:

## Circuits
Circuits are a mechanism for contest creators to direct earnings to independent smart contracts that perform onchain transactions. That means that whenever a player in a contest enters, votes, or performs any kind of action generating earnings, they can simultaneously perform any onchain action, such as buying tokens, minting collectibles, providing liquidity, or earning credentials—all as part of playing in a contest.

Check out the [technical documentation page](/technical-how-tos/circuits) for more in-depth information.

## Use Cases

### How can I use JokeRace for points and reputation?

One easy way to imagine JokeRace is as a ledger of user preferences and attestations. Whenever one person votes for an entry, they’re expressing a preference for it—and attesting to its value. Likewise whenever a person who has entered an entry earns a vote, they’re earning an attestation that their entry was valuable to the community that voted.

What this means is that even if you lose a contest, you still win—because you’re earning reputation. For example, if a community designed a simple point system that offered one “point” for every vote a person received, they would be able to gauge the value that this person had contributed to the community—by merely adding up the onchain votes over time. With a legitimate voterpool, this system couldn’t be botted or overrun by airdrop farmers. Submitters would actually have to create value for the community to earn value in return.

But this is just one example. In fact, because JokeRace is fully onchain, you can use any data point from contests to determine your own system of rewarding reputation.

To get analytics on your contest, tap the “extensions” tab and “see analytics” button. your contest dashboard shows you everyone who entered and voted. just pull their addresses and you can give them
- airdrops
- community access
- credentials
- reimbursements

### Is JokeRace a quests platform?

JokeRace is a contests platform, not a quests platform—though it is actually quite complementary with most quests platforms.

Quests platforms offer incentives for anyone who performs a series of tasks with a service. 

Contests only offer rewards to winners, who are selected by voters.

Even then, contest creators have the option whether or not to add a rewards pool to their contest and may elect to run a contest without one (if, for example, they are using a contest to make a decision, or if they want to offer other kinds of rewards besides tokens).

While quests platforms are quite good at getting a large quantity of users and bots to perform the same action, contests are good for getting quality users to compete with original entries.

And this is why quests and contests can be complementary. For example, you might just allowlist anyone to enter or vote who’s performed a quest—incentivizing them to perform the quest in order to participate in the contest for greater rewards. Or you might create a quest to incentivize people to enter or vote in a contest to increase engagement. Finally, you might use the metrics from a contest to determine who your quality users are—for example, giving one “point” for each vote that entrants have gotten across your contests. You could then use these metrics to allowlist future quests to prevent bots from participating.

### I’ve already collected applications, nominations, or entries from another site. Is there a way to import them into a contest for others to vote on?

You can always set up a contest that only you enter into—if you like, you can even allowlist the entries so that only you can enter.

However, we strongly recommend letter users enter directly to get the full benefits of onchain contests, including:

- Onchain reputation (ie every vote they get could be a point attesting to value of their project)
- Rewards for winners onchain
- Monetization (you can set entry fees that we split with you 90/10)

If you do choose to enter directly, you’ll need to cover the entry fees for the contest yourself and will lose the advantages above.

### How can a contest fund itself?

After you create a contest, you can create a rewards pool as well on the contest’s rewards page. When you create the rewards pool, just turn on the toggle on the final screen to send all earnings to the rewards pool.

How does this work? Well, JokeRace split all fees from users with contest creators. So when you turn on self-funding, instead of collecting your fees, you’re choosing for them to go directly into the rewards pool. That means that 90% of all fees go back into rewards.

Price curves further enhance self-funding. By incentivizing early voters to buy votes at lower prices, price curves seed the rewards pool earlier, kickstarting the participation flywheel and boosting engagement—especially useful when contest creators have limited initial funds.

This is the magic of programmable money.

### What are the benefits of self-funding?

First, you can enable financial incentives for contests without putting up any money of your own. This can be a powerful tool to incentivize participation.

But second, this creates a flywheel. The more people that participate, the higher the rewards go. And the higher the rewards go, the more incentive there is to participate.

Third, it adds extra incentives for entrants to get as many votes as possible. The more people that vote for them, the more money they stand to earn—and the more likely they are to win. This can create dynamic competitions with players.

Finally, in anyone-can-vote-contests, it can help prevent arbitrage opportunities that accompany traditional rewards. For example, in an externally funded contest, players may be incentivized to buy up votes in order to get the rewards. If the prize pool is $500, for example, they may want to spend hundreds of dollars to try to win in order to earn. This can be a very fun game of its own, but self-funding helps avoid it. Since users only get back 90% of what they put in, they’re much less incentivized to try to arbitrage a prize pool (since even if it’s quite large, that’s likely due to voting on other entries). 

## AI Agents

### Is there a way to get AI agents to play in contests?

[James Young](https://x.com/jamesyoung) has devised a framework to create AI agents that can interact on JokeRace. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/collabland/AI-Agent-Starter-Kit/blob/b235d05ee05e4386ed433dae2e1bec85156507cc/.env.example#L12).

## Dashboards

### How do I access my contest dashboard?

1. Navigate to your contest page
2. Click the "Extensions" tab
3. Select "See Analytics"
4. Click "Run" to load the latest data

Notes:
- Be patient - initial data loading can take several minutes
- Click "Run" anytime you want to refresh the data
- Not all contests have dashboards available - if the chain that a contest is on is not supported by [Dune](https://dune.com/) then it will not have a dashboard

### What data can I see?

The dashboard shows:
- Total revenue
- Number of entries and entrants
- Number of votes and unique voters
- Entry IDs and voter addresses
- Proposer addresses
- Detailed voting patterns
