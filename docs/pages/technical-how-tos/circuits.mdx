# Circuits

Circuits are a mechanism for contest creators to direct earnings to independent smart contracts that perform onchain transactions. That means that whenever a player in a contest submits, votes, or performs any kind of action generating earnings, they can simultaneously perform any onchain action, such as buying tokens, minting collectibles, providing liquidity, or earning credentials—all as part of playing in a contest.

And that, in turn, means that programmatic circuits can be built to supercharge engagement, pump token prices, and onboard players onto new services.

## Token Buybacks

You can point your contest's creator earnings to a contract that buys back your community's token every time someone submits or votes in your contest.

### Deploy the buyback contract

Instructions to do so are on the repository [here](https://github.com/jk-labs-inc/auto-buy-contract).

### Route creator earnings to the buyback contract

In the monetization step of the create flow, set the "another wallet" field below to be the address of the deployed buyback contract.

### Create your contest!

Once your contest is live, all submitting and voting transactions on it will directly buy your token and send it to the player who is submitting or voting!
