# JokeRace Onchain Data

## Structure

All [JokeRace contracts](https://github.com/jk-labs-inc/jokerace/tree/staging/packages/forge/src) are standardized to version across all chains. To see what version a contract is you just have to call the `version()` function, and that contract version is going to be the same on all chains.

The ABIs and flattend Solidity files for all of the different versions are [here](https://github.com/jk-labs-inc/jokerace/tree/staging/packages/react-app-revamp/contracts/bytecodeAndAbi).
