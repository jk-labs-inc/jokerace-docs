# Troubleshooting

- If you are having trouble getting a transaction to go through, please first try using another browswer and/or another wallet.
  - We have consistently had issues with Brave and Arc, so would suggest trying Chrome if using one of those browswers and running into issues.

- If you want to know if a transaction has gone through, please check the block explorer of the chain that you are transacting on - if the transaction has completed onchain, then the transaction has successfully completed and is recorded on the blockchain.
