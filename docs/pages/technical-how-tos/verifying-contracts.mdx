# Verifying Contracts

Below are the steps to verify a contract you deployed through JokeRace.

::::steps

## Determine the contract's version

First, run the below command in your terminal to download and install [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry).

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz â€‹| bash && foundryup
```

Then run this command with the contract address and the RPC url for the chain that the contract is on (you can find a public RPC url to use on our Github [here](https://github.com/jk-labs-inc/jokerace/tree/staging/packages/react-app-revamp/config/wagmi/custom-chains) if you don't have one already) to return the version of that contract.

```bash
cast call <CONTRACT ADDRESS> "version()(string)" --rpc-url "<RPC_URL>"
```

## Copy the flattened file of that contract version

For `Contest` contracts, look for the flattened filed in the respective version's folder [here](https://github.com/jk-labs-inc/jokerace/tree/staging/packages/react-app-revamp/contracts/bytecodeAndAbi).

For `VoterRewardsModule` contracts, look for the flattened filed in the respective version's folder [here](https://github.com/jk-labs-inc/jokerace/tree/staging/packages/react-app-revamp/contracts/bytecodeAndAbi/modules).

## Verify the contract

In whatever block explorer you're using, input this information into where it enables you to verify (usually the Code tab) and you should be good to go:
- Compiler Type: Single file
- Compiler Version: v0.8.19
- License Type: GNU Affero General Public License (GNU AGPLv3)
- Optimization: Yes
- Solidity Contract Code: Paste the copied flattened file from the previous step
