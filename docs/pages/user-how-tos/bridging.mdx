# Ruh-roh… I need funds. Wen moneys?

If you don’t have funds to play in the contest, you’re in one of two camps.

## Camp One: I have money in my wallet, but it says I need to add funds.

Good news. Your money is just on a different chain (network) from the one where the contest is held.

You’ll just need to transfer your money from its current chain to the one that the contest is on by using a third-party bridge.

We recommend using a “bridge aggregator” which will let you choose from dozens of services. The major ones are:

- [https://jumper.exchange](https://jumper.exchange/)
- [https://www.squidrouter.com/](https://www.squidrouter.com/)

Just about any major bridge will be featured in these aggregators, but if they don’t support the chain you want, you should check the official site of the chain itself to see if they support a bridge.

Not sure what chain the contest is on? You probably got a message like “add eth to base to get votes.” Here, eth is the token (money) you need, and base is the chain. But you can always see what chain a contest is on in the contest url, which is formatted jokerace.io/contest/[chain].

## Camp Two: I’ve never used this wallet, so I have no funds on it.

Here, you’re going to need to add funds. You’ll need to transfer from another wallet (account). We recommend setting up an account with an onboarding service like:

- [https://coinbase.com/](https://coinbase.com/)
- [https://www.moonpay.com/](https://www.moonpay.com/)

You can add funds there, and then transfer to your wallet. To find the address of your wallet, tap the button on the upper right in desktop (beginning “0x…”) and tap “copy address.” On mobile, tap the “profile” button in the lower right and then the link icon below the 0x address to copy the address.

When sending funds, make sure to send funds to the chain that the contest is on. If you got a message like ““add eth to base to get votes,” then “base” here is the chain. You can always see what chain a contest is on in the contest url, which is formatted jokerace.io/contest/[chain].

As always, do your own diligence in using any third-party service. jk labs inc. bears no liability for any handling of funds outside our own site.
