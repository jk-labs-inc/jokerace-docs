# Ruh-roh… I need funds.

If you don’t have funds to play in the contest, you’re in one of two camps.

## Option One: Transfer funds from one chain to another. 

You have money in your wallet, but you need to move it to the chain of the contestby using a third-party bridge.

We recommend using a “bridge aggregator” which will let you choose from dozens of services. The major ones are:

- [https://jumper.exchange](https://jumper.exchange/)
- [https://relay.link/bridge/](https://relay.link/bridge/)
- [https://shapeshift.com/](https://shapeshift.com/)

If they don’t support the chain you want, check the official site of the chain itself.

When you tap “add funds,” you should see a logo showing you what chain the contest is on. (You can also find it in the url of the contest.)

## Option Two: I need to add funds from fiat.

Here, you’re going to need to add funds. You’ll need to transfer from another wallet (account). We recommend setting up an account with an onboarding service like:

- [https://coinbase.com/](https://coinbase.com/)
- [https://www.moonpay.com/](https://www.moonpay.com/)

You can add funds there, and then transfer to your wallet. To find the address of your wallet, tap the button on the upper right in desktop (beginning “0x…”) and tap “copy address.” On mobile, tap the “profile” button in the lower right and then the link icon below the 0x address to copy the address.

When sending funds, make sure to send funds to the chain that the contest is on. If you got a message like ““add eth to base to get votes,” then “base” here is the chain. You can always see what chain a contest is on in the contest url, which is formatted jokerace.io/contest/[chain].

As always, do your own diligence in using any third-party service. jk labs inc. bears no liability for any handling of funds outside our own site.
